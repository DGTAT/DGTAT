### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Our account was created specifically for ICLR2024 and strictly follows the double-blind rules. This code repository mainly provides all the modules of DGTAT, including:

*the LapPE node positional encoding initialization module

*the learnable Jaccard positional encoding initialization module

*the RRWP edge positional encoding initialization module

*the RRSE learnable node structural encoding initialization module

*the data processing and virtual node addition modules

*the triple-attention DGTAT layer and the DGTAT model.

We use Citeseer for the data processing and dataset example here. All the ablation experiments in our paper can be done by selectively adding different modules to the DGTAT model. Experimental details and reference results can be found our paper.
