### Welcome to our code repository of paper DGTAT: DECOUPLED GRAPH TRIPLE ATTENTION NETWORKS ðŸ‘‹
Our account was created specifically for ICLR2024 and strictly follows the double-blind rules. This code repository mainly provides all the modules of DGTAT, including:

The LapPE node positional encoding initialization module

The learnable Jaccard positional encoding initialization module

The RRWP edge positional encoding initialization module

The RRSE learnable node structural encoding initialization module

The data processing and virtual node addition modules

The triple-attention DGTAT layer and the DGTAT model

We use Citeseer for the data processing and dataset example here. All the ablation experiments in our paper can be done by selectively adding different modules to the DGTAT model. Experimental details and reference results can be found our paper.
